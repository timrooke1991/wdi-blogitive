This project was to build a Full Stake application, I chose to build a blogging platform coupled with IBM Watson's sentiment analysis API. This shows how negative or positive a post is. It also analyses comments on blog posts, and specific concepts mentioned within the blog post text. The site has login functionality as well as oAuth login functionality for Facebook, Instagram and Github.

For this project, I used the IBM Watson Sentiment Analysis API. The API is used in Blogitive to scan text - both articles and comments - to determine overall positivity or negativity. However, the API also returns specific topics and concepts relevant to the article or comment. Topics or concepts may not be referenced in the text, but are deduced using the Artificial Intelligence.

The biggest challenge of the application was working with the API payload. This came in a large object, so I had toÂ plan what data I wanted to use and store this in the database. Once done, this allows me to access the data in a more manageable way, which made including this in my application easier.

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

- Refinement to styling and layouts
- Add global user concepts. For example, across all the posts created by the user display the most commonly discussed topics.
- Allow users to select topics they were interested in and by default show them articles relating to these categories.
