# Project 1 - Blogitive
 
## Setup
 
Project is available at:
 
- [https://aqueous-lake-61312.herokuapp.com](https://aqueous-lake-61312.herokuapp.com)
 
## Description
 
This project was to build a Full Stake application, I chose to build a blogging platform couple with IBM Watson's sentiment analysis API. This shows how negative or positive a post is. It also analyses comments on blog posts, and specific concepts mentioned within the blog post text. 

## Technologies used
 
The list of the software and languages used in the project, for example:
 
- HTML 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery 3.10
- Gulp
- Node
- Express
- Mongo
- Yarn
- NPM
- Git & github
 
## Challenges faced
 
The biggest challenge of the application was working with the API payload. This came in a large object, so I have plan what data I wanted to use and store this in the database. Once done, this allow me to access the data in a more manageable way, which made including this in my application easier. 
 
## Rounding it off
 
Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:
 
- Refinement to styling and layouts
- Add global user concepts, e.g. across all the posts created by the user display their most commonly discussed topics.
- Allow users to select topics they were interested in and by default show them articles relating to these categories.
